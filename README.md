basic commands, file system navigation, permissions, and practice tasks.

## Topics Covered

## Why Linux for DevOps?
Linux is the foundation of DevOps. Most servers run on Linux,
and DevOps engineers must be comfortable with terminal operations.

## Practice Work
I practiced these commands daily on terminal and documented
my learning and outputs.
